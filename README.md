# Keen IO Spreadsheet

This is a simple integration into Google Spreadsheets that allows you to insert data into [Keen.io](https://keen.io/).

Merely visit [this spreadsheet](https://goo.gl/qjde1V) and copy it into your own account.  Replace `$PROJECT_ID`, `$EVENT_COLLECTION`, and `$WRITE_KEY`.  Then go into the **"Keen"** menu and choose **"Send Data to Keen (Insert)"**

The script that is incorporated into the spreadsheet is included in this repository as well (you can also view it directly after you copy the spreadsheet).
